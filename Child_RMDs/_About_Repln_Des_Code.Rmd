# About this code

## Motivation
This program can be used to generate pilot survey efficient design and choice cards for studies to replicate a Discrete Choice Experiment study that is currently being written up. Future versions of this program will include details of the parent study.

## Status
This code has is a re-organised version of the script we used in the original study (refer to the Pilot_Design_Reproduction.pdf file).

## Use
When using this code it is important to note that some of the steps in this program involve interactivity - they generate a prompt that a user must respond to before proceeding. Therefore, **this code should be run step by step** (i.e run one chunk at a time and do not try to run the program by knitting the R Markdown version of this code). Although it would be possible to add work-arounds to the interactivity issue, running the program by knitting the RMD version is still not recommended as it will prevent the documents generated by this program from rendering properly.
