# About this code

## Motivation
This program generates a pilot survey efficient design and HTML choice cards for a Discrete Choice Experiment study that is currently being written up. Future versions of this program will include details of the parent study.

## Status
This code has been adapted from the code originally used in the study to make it easier to generalise. If you have access to the study dataset, this code will generate an identical pilot design to that used in our study. It is planned for future releases of this program to include synthetic data to allow those without access to the study dataset to run it as a replication program from start to finish. Running the program with synthetic data will produce an efficient design with different choice sets to that produced in the original study.

## Use
When using this code it is important to note that some of the steps in this program involve interactivity - they generate a prompt that a user must respond to before proceeding. Therefore, **this code should be run step by step** (i.e run one chunk at a time and do not try to run the program by knitting the R Markdown version of this code).
