# Share work
The final step is to share our non-confidential work outputs with others in an online repository. Note, if you don't have write permissions for `X`, you should replace `X` with an alternative `Ready4useRepos` object that provides details of a repository for which you have write permissions.

```{r eval = FALSE}
Y <- share(X,
           obj_to_share_xx = dce_design_ls,
           fl_nm_1L_chr = ifelse(reproduce_1L_lgl,"DDD_updated_dce_design_ls","CCC_updated_dce_design_ls"),
           description_1L_chr = paste0("DCE design specification post analysis of pilot data - ",
                                       ifelse(reproduce_1L_lgl,"reproduction","replication")," (output of dce_sa_design program)"))
```
