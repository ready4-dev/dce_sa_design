# Share work
The final step is to share our work with others in an online repository. Note, you will need to supply your own repository details to run this part of the code successfully as you will not have write permissions to the repositories that we specify below.

```{r eval = FALSE}
X <- Ready4useRepos(dv_nm_1L_chr = "springtolife", # Replace with values for a dataverse & dataset for which
                    dv_ds_nm_1L_chr = "https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VGPIPS", #  you have write permissions.
                    dv_server_1L_chr = "dataverse.harvard.edu")
Y <- share(X,
           obj_to_share_xx = list(choices_tb = choices_tb,
                                  mu = mu,
                                  pilot_design_ls = no_app_optout_ls,
                                  survey_ls = survey_ls,
                                  v = v),
           fl_nm_1L_chr = "AAA_pilot_design_ls",
           description_1L_chr = "List object to help reproduce pilot survey (output of dce_sa_design reproduction program)")
